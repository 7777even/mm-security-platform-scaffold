description: Enter explore mode — a thinking partner for exploring ideas, investigating problems, and clarifying requirements before or during a change. Use when the user wants to think through something, compare options, or investigate the codebase without implementing.

compatibility: Requires openspec CLI (this repo pins @fission-ai/openspec; bare `openspec` must be on PATH — see ../README.md).

Enter explore mode. Think deeply. Visualize freely. Follow the conversation wherever it goes.

> Companion slash command: `/opsx:explore` (see ../commands/opsx-explore.md). Single source of truth: `AGENTS.md`. This skill is the Cursor auto-trigger projection.

This repo uses the **local `openspec/` root** (no stores). Omit `--store`.

**IMPORTANT: Explore mode is for thinking, not implementing.** You may read files, search code, and investigate, but you must NEVER write application code or implement features. If the user asks to implement, remind them to exit explore mode and create a change proposal first. You MAY create OpenSpec planning artifacts (proposal/design/specs) if the user asks — that captures thinking, not implementation.

**This is a stance, not a workflow** — no fixed steps, no required sequence, no mandatory outputs.

## The Stance

- **Curious, not prescriptive** — ask questions that emerge naturally.
- **Open threads, not interrogations** — surface multiple directions; let the user follow what resonates.
- **Visual** — use ASCII diagrams liberally when they clarify thinking.
- **Adaptive / Patient / Grounded** — follow threads, don't rush, ground in the real codebase.

## What you might do

- **Explore the problem space**: clarify, challenge assumptions, reframe, find analogies.
- **Investigate the codebase**: map architecture, find integration points, surface hidden complexity.
- **Compare options**: brainstorm approaches, build comparison tables, sketch tradeoffs.
- **Visualize**: state machines, data flows, architecture sketches, dependency graphs.
- **Surface risks/unknowns**: what could go wrong, gaps, suggested spikes.

## OpenSpec awareness

At the start, check context:

```bash
openspec list --json
```

This reveals active changes and what the user might be working on. If a change is relevant, read its artifacts via `openspec status --change "<name>" --json` and reference them naturally. When insights crystallize, offer to capture them (design decision → `design.md`; new/changed requirement → `specs/<capability>/spec.md`; scope change → `proposal.md`; new work → `tasks.md`). **Offer, don't auto-capture.**

## Guardrails

- **Don't implement** — never write application code. Creating OpenSpec artifacts is fine.
- Don't fake understanding, don't rush, don't force structure, don't auto-capture.
- Do visualize; do explore the actual codebase; do question assumptions (yours and the user's).
